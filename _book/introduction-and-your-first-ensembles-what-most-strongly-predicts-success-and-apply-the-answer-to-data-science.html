<p>My journey to the most advanced AI in the world started with an actual
blizzard in Chicago. It might seem like Chicago would never get a
blizzard, but we did in 2011, and it was incredibly intense, as this
video shows:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPiFn52ztd8" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPiFn52ztd8</a></p>
<p>What does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Groundhog_Day_blizzard">Chicago 2011
Snomageddon</a>
have to do with the creation of the most advanced AI? Everything. Here’s
the story.</p>
<p>At the time of the 2011 Blizzard I worked a Recruiter for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Services">Kelly
Services</a>, where I had
worked since 1996. I agreed to work out of the Kelly Services office in
Frankfort, Illinois at this time, though I worked out of nearly every
Kelly Services office at one time or another. The trip to Frankfort
involved a daily commute to the office, but I was able to make the best
use of the time on the road.</p>
<p>My manager at the time let me know several days in advance that there
was a very large amount of snow forecast, and that I might want to be
prepared. The most recent forecasts for large amounts of snow in the
Chicago area all amounted to nothing. They were perfectly normal days in
the Chicago area, so I predicted this storm would also be nothing, based
on the most recent results. This was a great example of a prior
prediction not transferring well to a current situation.</p>
<p>That morning I went to work as normal, and did not even look at the
weather forecast. Around 2:45 pm my manager came out of her office and
said “Russ, you need to come here and look at the weather radar!”. I
walked into her office, and saw a map of a winter storm that was
incredibly huge. She had the image zoomed out, so it was possible to see
several states. From what I could tell, the massive snow storm was
barreling down on Chicago, and was about 15 minutes away from our
location.</p>
<p>I told the candidate I was interviewing that I was leaving immediately,
and that he is not allowed to stay. He has to get home as fast as
possible for his own safety.</p>
<p>The storm started dropping snow on my trip north back home. The commute
took around 50% longer than normal due to the rapidly falling snow.</p>
<p>As I later learned, the storm was forecast to start in the Chicago area
around 3:00 pm, finish up between 11:00 am - 1:00 pm two days later, and
leave 17 - 19 inches of snow.</p>
<p>How bad was it? Even City of Chicago snow plows were stopped by the
snow:</p>

</div>
<p>To see what the forecasts looked like, check out this news report from
the day:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/blizzard-unleashes-winter-fury/2096753/" class="uri">https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/blizzard-unleashes-winter-fury/2096753/</a></p>
<p>It turns out all three predictions of the blizzard were accurate to a
level that almost seemed uncanny to me: Start time, accumulation, and
end time were all spot on. This is the first time I recall ever seeing a
prediction at this level of accuracy. I had no idea this type of
predictive accuracy was even possible. This level of accuracy in
predicting results totally blew me away. I had never seen anything with
this level of accuracy, and now I wanted to know how it was done.</p>
<p>I searched and searched for how the accuracy was so high for this
forecast.</p>
<p>The power of the method—whatever it was—was obvious to me. I realized
that if it could work for the weather, the solution method could work in
an incredibly broad range of situations. A few of many other areas
include business forecasts, production work, modeling prices, and much,
much more. But that this point I had no idea how the accurate prediction
was done.</p>
<p>Some months later a person wrote to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Skilling">Tom
Skilling</a>, chief
meteorologist for WGN TV in Chicago. Tom posted an answer that opened up
the solution for me. Here is the relevant part of Tom Skilling’s answer
how the forecast was so accurate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Weather Service has developed an interesting “SNOWFALL ENSEMBLE
FORECAST PROBABILITY SYSTEM” which draws upon a wide range of snow
accumulation forecasts from a whole set of different computer models.
By “blending” these model projections, probability of snowfalls
falling within certain ranges becomes possible. Also, this “blending”
of multiple forecasts “smooths” the sometimes huge model disparities
in the amounts being predicted. The resulting probabilities therefore
represent a “best case” forecast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that was the first step. Ensembles were the way they achieved such
extraordinary prediction accuracy.</p>
<p>My next goal was to figure out how ensembles were made. As I looked up
information, it became obvious that ensembles had been used for a while,
such as the winning entry in the Netflix Prize Competition:</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="_book/images/netflix_prize.jpg" alt="Netflix Prize Competition"><div class="figcaption">Netflix Prize Competition</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize">Netflix Prize
Competition</a> was sponsored
by Netflix to create a method to accurately predict user ratings on
films. The minimum winning score needed to beat the Netflix method
(named Cinematch) by at least 10%. Several years of work went into
solving this problem, and the results even included several published
papers. The winning solution was an ensemble of methods that beat the
Cinematch results by 10.09%.</p>
<p>So it was now clear to me that ensembles were the path forward. However,
I had no idea how to make ensembles.</p>
<p>I went to graduate school to study data science and predictive
analytics. My degree was completed in 2017, from Northwestern
University. However, I still was not sure how ensembles of models were
built, nor could I find any clear methods to build them (except for
pre-made methods, such as random forests). While it is true there were
packages that could do some of the work, nothing I found did what I was
looking for: How to build ensembles of models in general. Despite
playing with the idea and looking online, I was not able to build the
ensembles I wanted to build.</p>
<p>Everything changed on Saturday, October 15, 2022 at 4:58 pm. I was
playing with various methods to make an ensemble, and got an ensemble
that worked for the very first time. While the results were extremely
modest by any standards, it was clear to me that the foundation was
there to build a general solution that can work in an extremely wide
range of areas. Here is my journal entry:</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="_book/images/Birth_of_ensembles.jpg" alt="Birth of the ensembles method (typo of W0w in the original)"><div class="figcaption">Birth of the ensembles method (typo of W0w in the
original)</div>
</div>
<p>You might be asking yourself how I know the day and time. That is a very
reasonable question. I’ve been keeping a journal since I was 19 years
old, and have thousands of entries. As soon as I realized how to
correctly build ensembles, I made this entry, which contains the key
elements to make an ensemble, and we will do these steps in just a
moment. Notice that the subject line in the journal matches the text
above.</p>
<p>One of the ways to improve your skills is to keep a journal, and we’ll
be looking at that in more depth in this chapter and future chapters.
The journal I use is <a href="https://danschimpf.com/">MacJournal</a>, though there
are a large number of other options available on the market.</p>

<p>Here is what an ensemble of models looks like at the most basic level,
using the Boston Housing data set as an example:</p>
<p>Data (example—head of Boston Housing, the training data)</p>
<p>The simplest possible ensemble of two models: linear predictions and
tree predictions, and the true values (named y_ensemble)</p>
<p>Our first ensemble: The easiest possible ensemble of models</p>
<p>We will start our first ensemble with a data set that only has numerical
values. Our first example will use the Boston Housing data set, from the
MASS package. While the Boston Housing data set is controversial (and we
will discuss some of the controversies in our example making
professional quality reports for the C-Suite), for now it works as a
very well known data set to begin our journey into ensembles.</p>
<p>Overview of the most basic steps to make an ensemble:</p>
<p>We will be using the Boston Housing data set, so let’s have a look at
some Boston images:</p>
