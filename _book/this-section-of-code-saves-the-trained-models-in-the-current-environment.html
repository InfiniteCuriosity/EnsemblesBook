<p>What about classification, logistic and time series data?</p>
<p>In subsequent chapters we will do similar processes with classification,
logistic and time series data. It’s possible to build ensembles with all
these types of data. The results are extremely similar to the results
we’ve seen here with numerical data: While the ensembles won’t always
have the best results, it is best to have a diverse set of models and
ensembles to get the best possible results.</p>
<p>Principle: Ensembles can work with many types of data, and we will do
that in this book</p>
<p>Can it make predictions on totally new data from the trained
models—including the ensembles?</p>
<p>The solutions in this book are independent of the use of the data. We
will look at everything from housing prices to business analysis to HR
analytics to research in medicine. One of our later examples will do
exactly what this question is asking—build individual and ensemble
models from data, then use those pre-trained models to make predictions
on totally unseen data. You will develop this set of skills later in the
book, but it’s a minor extension of what you’re already seen and
completed.</p>
<p>The way I was taught how to write code was totally wrong for me: The
best way for me is to start at the end and work backward from there. Do
not start coding looking for a solution, instead, start with the ending
and work backwards from there.</p>
<p>Start at the end and work backwards from there</p>
<p>The biggest lesson for me in all of this work is how to make ensembles.
You’ve already seen some of the steps, and there are more results to
come. The second biggest lesson is that everything I was taught about
how to do data science and AI was backwards to what actually works for
me in real life. I’ve learned how I learn, and applied that skill
(learning how I learn) to a wide range of skills, including:</p>
<p>• Running a multi-million dollar division of a Fortune 1000 company,
including full profit and loss responsibility</p>
<p>• Performing at a professional level on many musical instruments</p>
<p>• Able to communicate in English, Spanish and sign language in a
professional setting</p>
<p>• Earning the #1 place on the annual undergradate university mathematics
competition—twice</p>
<p>• Completing a Master’s degree in Guidance and Counseling, allowing me
to help many people in their path toward a healthier life</p>
<p>• Leader of the Oak Park, Illinois chapter of Amnesty International for
ten years, helping to release several Prisoners of Conscience</p>
<p>• President of the Chicago Apple User Group for ten years, helping many
people do extremely good work with their hardware and software</p>
<p>• Leg press 1,000 pounds ten times in a row</p>
<p>• Climbed a mountain in Colorado</p>
<p>• Completed multiple skydives (and looking forward to doing more)</p>
<p>The point here is that I have learned how I learn, and I’ve applied that
skill to many areas. When I started learning data science/AI/coding, it
was all very different from the way I was being creative my whole life.
The way that works for me is to start at the end, work backward from
there, and never give up. Maybe the best evidence of the success of this
method is this fact:</p>
<p>When I started to write the code that led to the Ensembles package, I
followed those steps: Start at the end, work backward from there, and
never give up. I wound up writing an average of 1,000 lines of clean,
error free code per month for 15 months. The Ensembles package is around
15,000 lines of clean, error free code.</p>
<p>I found my attitude was much more important than my skill set, by a long
shot.</p>
<p>How I stuck with it all the way to the end: The best career advice I
ever received was from a homeless man I never met, and answers the
question of what most strongly predicts success.</p>
<p>Ashford and Simpson</p>
<p>Learning about building ensembles will help you make more accurate
predictions. That’s an extrdmely good skill to have in any setting. But
I found the most important thing to predict is success. This has been
studied, and there are quite a few good works on the subject, both
academic and for the general population.</p>
<p>My favorite career advice—which I listened to nearly every day as I
worked on the Ensembles project—is from a man who was homeless at the
time he came up with the words.</p>
<p>Nick Ashford was from Willow Run, Michigan. He moved to New York, hoping
to get into the entertainment world as a dancer. Unfortunately he ended
up homeless on the streets of New York. He slept on park benches, and
got food from soup kitchens.</p>
<p>He heard that the people at White Rock Baptist Church would feed him (a
homeless man) a normal meal, so Nick went there one Sunday morning. He
met the people, especially the choir members, and started working with
the piano player in the choir. Her name is Valerie Simpson.</p>
<p>Soon Nick and Valerie were writing songs for the church choir. Nick
mentioned that while he was homeless, he realized that New York wasn’t
going to “do me in”. He was determined. The words he put down say:</p>
<p>Ain’t no mountain high enough</p>
<p>Ain’t no valley low enough</p>
<p>Ain’t no river wide enough</p>
<p>Valerie took those words, and set them to music. They sent that song to
Motown, who released it with Marvin Gaye and Tammy Terrell covering the
vocals. It was later re-done by Ashford and Simpson and Paul Riser, with
Diana Ross singing the lead.</p>
<p>Here is a short video that summarizes that experience, and concludes
with the finale of the 1970 version of the song. This attitude that
Ashford and Simpson expressed in song is extremely highly predictive of
success, no matter what the field of endeavor. I found this extremely
motivating, and used it to overcome any obstacles and challenges I had
while on the journey.</p>
<p>While I have the skill of knowing how I learn (which I will continue to
share with you in this book), this attitude of working no matter how
high the mountain or long the valley or wide the river, gives me the how
and the why to keep moving toward success, until that success is fully
achieved.</p>
<p>Later on we will look at how to make presentations, consider this as an
example of the level of quality that can be done:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/002bNfVreagRYCYHAZ9GyQ02w#Ain't%5FNo%5FMountain%5FHigh%5FEnough" class="uri">https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/002bNfVreagRYCYHAZ9GyQ02w#Ain’t%5FNo%5FMountain%5FHigh%5FEnough</a></p>
<p>Exercises:</p>
<p>Find your data science Genesis. The data science idea that totally
excites you and gets you out of bed every day. The idea that leads to
the creation of many other ideas. The biggest and boldest dreams you can
possibly have. The idea that is so strong that you have to do it. Not
for yourself, but for the benefit of all who will use it and receive all
the good it will create.</p>
<p>Keep a journal of your progress. It’s much easier to see results over
time when there is a record. Set the journal up today (or this week). I
did not use Github as a journal. My journal was for crazy ideas,
contradictory evidence, writing down my frustrations and successes,
inspiration, the one next thing I worked on, and having a rock solid
record of the path to success. Seeing the path I traversed was a huge
motivation to finishing the project.</p>
<p>Do your best to add journal entries to your regular schedule.</p>
<p>Make an ensemble using the Boston Housing data set. Model any of the
other 13 columns of data, not the median value of the home (14th column)
which we have been working on in this chapter.</p>
<p>Start planning for your comprehensive project. What types of data are
you most interested in? What patterns would you like to discover? Begin
looking online now for possible data sets, and so a little basic
research. More examples will be provided as we get closer to that
section of the book.</p>
